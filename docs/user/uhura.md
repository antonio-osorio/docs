The Uhura SDM performs delivery automatically on enabled projects. It looks at the content
of the project and decides what to do.

Currently the Uhura SDM knows how to build Node projects with `build`, `test`, or `lint` scripts
defined in `package.json`. This SDM is designed to add more capabilities to deliver different stacks.

For more information, check the project on [GitHub][].
