Deployment is the goal of delivery, so you probably want a deployment [goal](goal.md).

We have some pre-built ones:

* [Kubernetes](../pack/kubernetes/index.md)
* [Cloud Foundry](../pack/pcf.md)

Use these, fork these and change them, or program your deployment in a [custom goal][create-goal]. [Set them](../developer/set-goals.md) along with other
goals in your delivery flows.
