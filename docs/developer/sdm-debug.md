# Debugging an SDM

You can debug your SDM on your laptop. Instead of `atomist start` at the command line, start it up in a debugger in your favorite tool.

## VSCode

In [VSCode][debug-vscode], the debug configuration looks like:

```
{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Launch SDM",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/@atomist/automation-client/bin/start.js",
  "env": {
      "ATOMIST_MODE": ""
  },
  "outputCapture": "std",
}
```

If you want the SDM to run in local mode, put "local" in the ATOMIST_MODE environment variable.

* In the menu, click Run and go to Edit Configurations
* Click on the + sign in the top left corner to add a new configuration
