The "D" in SDM stands for Delivery, so it stands to reason that you can also configure your SDM to deliver your software. A delivery takes the form of a deployment to a production or staging environment, after your code has passed all of its fixes, builds, checks, and so forth.

Deliveries are established by setting up [Goals](https://docs.atomist.com/developer/goal/), so be sure to read through that documentation for more information!
